Formatting Issues:

The contact section lacks proper formatting and clarity.
Overuse of bullet points without distinction of impact or context.
Fix: Create a structured header for the contact information and ensure consistent spacing throughout the resume.

Vagueness in Professional Experience:

The job responsibilities are overly generic (e.g., "Managed various projects successfully" or "Improved company processes").
Achievements and contributions are not quantified.
Fix: Rewrite bullet points to include specific metrics, results, or key outcomes. Focus on actionable impact.

Education Section Formatting:

The Bachelor‚Äôs degree doesn‚Äôt include graduation dates, which can lead to confusion.
Degree names are inconsistent (e.g., "Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science" instead of "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science").
Fix: Add graduation dates and standardize degree naming.

Skills Section:

The skills are a mix of technical and soft skills without clear categorization.
Missing keywords relevant to modern industry practices (e.g., JavaScript, React, or other popular technologies).
Fix: Separate technical and interpersonal skills and include modern, in-demand technologies.

Languages Section:

The language proficiency for French is missing, which leaves the section incomplete.
Fix: Add a proficiency level for French to match the format of English.
